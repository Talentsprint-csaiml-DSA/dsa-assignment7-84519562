# Assignment 4: Longest common subsequence 

## Problem Statement:

You are tasked to find the longest sequence of characters that appear in the same order in both strings but are not necessarily contiguous.

## Definitions:
   Given two strings X and Y, find the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS) and optionally return the subsequence itself.

## Input:
   - Two Strings
          Ex: 'cloud' and 'loud'

## Output:
   - Length of the LCS
          Ex: 4.       - LCS = 'loud'

for further info please refer to the Longest Common Subsequence lecture.
